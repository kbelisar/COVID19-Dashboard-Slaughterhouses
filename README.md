# COVID19-Dashboard-Slaughterhouses
 A leisure project depicting COVID-19 Cases in Canadian Slaughterhouses. Although the numbers are likely vastly under-reported, and do not include those indirectly effected from outbreaks at slaughterhouses, this dashboard offers a way to visualize these data and a template for similar data projects.
