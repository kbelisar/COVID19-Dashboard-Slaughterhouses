# COVID-19 Cases Amonst Slaughterhouse Workers - A Dashboard

This is a leisure project as a way to dive into the realm of dashboards made in R. It uses data from the Factory Farm Collective website to display COVID-19 cases and deaths of workers in Canadian Slaughterhouses. Although the numbers are likely vastly under-reported, and do not include those indirectly effected from outbreaks at slaughterhouses, this dashboard offers a way to visualize these data and a template for similar data projects.
